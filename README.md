# Cloud-Projects
AWS cloud projects

I plan to use this repository to work alongside my personal website.
I want to be able to use the website as a daily blog post on the changes I performed and why I chose to do such changes, and to add more tasks I want to still get done.
The github repo will hold all the code and allow me to get used to the flow of using github as if I am already in a company and get more practice using git commands correctly.
Each folder will be a new project that I have started and eventually some folders will have multiple subfolders that are additionally retries at the same project as I want to later time myself so I can make sure I know how to quickly and efficiently start any project or steps to start up a project that a team wants.
Additionally, I want to later incorporate a starting set of folders: easy, medium, hard, and expert, which would display the different levels of uniqueness the projects show. What I mean is that:
    - easy = Projects that I followed step by step from someone else's list and did not have to think for myself at all
    - medium = Projects that may have been created with the starting basis of someone else's idea or foundation but I tweak some code to display some of my own creativity. 
    - hard = Majority of the code is built from scratch with very little to no extra code that is added from other open sources. I want to aim to build these much quicker and put them into CloudFormation templates for easier creation later on.
    - expert = I start these projects with just an idea in mind, I do not think I would not have many of these ideas just yet (081522) as these projects would likely be started in hackathons or something similar where I am in a timed scenario and need to build the first thing that comes to mind and matches the criteria given.
